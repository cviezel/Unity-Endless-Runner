Endless runner made in Unity with custom animations and sounds for running, jumping, double jumping, and landing.

Yoshi will continuously run to the right, and the player controls when he jumps. Once in the air he has the ability to double jump, but cannot jump a third time. Yoshi resets both of his jumps upon landing on a platform.

Random platforms are procedurally generated and have 4 different properties. Normal platforms allow Yoshi to run on them normally. Ghost platforms disappear upon contact but allow Yoshi to reset his jumps. The solid black platform will fall as he runs on it, and the black and red platform rises as he runs on it.
